// When working with modules mapped by the OS in the current process, you can use the reexport `pelite::pe` to automatically select the right version.
// This is windows only, as it makes no sense to work with 'PE modules mapped by the OS' when that OS is not windows.
//
// The design reason for not unifying PE32 and PE64 is that while they may look similar, they're incompatible in some crucial ways.
// And I do not want to force overhead of matching between the two when most of the time you already know what you're working with.

	// If the compiler complains about missing symbols, you may not be running windows, or using the wrong PE pointer width version.

	// Note that not every module has imports (although this is pretty rare :)

		// INT: Import Name Table, this let's you know the imported symbol name or ordinal.
		//      Get an iterator over these with desc.int_iter()
		//
		// IAT: Import Address Table, contains the actual addresses of the imported symbols as used by the module.
		//      Get an iterator over these with desc.iat_iter()
		//
		// You can zip these together.
